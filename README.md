JWT Guard and dotnet dev certs
==============================

This is an experiment trying to get [JWT Guard](https://github.com/wcabus/jwt-guard) to work with [.NET Dev Certs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-dev-certs).  Spoiler: it didn't go well.

When the API is run, it uses [Microsoft Entra External ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/external-identities-overview).  When testing, it uses .NET Dev Certs.
